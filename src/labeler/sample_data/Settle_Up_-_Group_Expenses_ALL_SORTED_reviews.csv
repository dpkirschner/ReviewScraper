12311487166,US,iamwirking2,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id22190625,3.7.5,5,Top tier splitting app,"This is absolutely one of the best if not the best splitting app available. 

First- the most common activity on this kind of app is adding an expense on the go, so you want it to be quick and painless. Settle up by far has the fastest expense adding framework, because you can start by tapping the name of the person who paid. Seems like a small thing, but it makes a big difference in the field. 

Second- exporting transactions is not behind a paywall. 

Third- unlimited transactions not behind paywall. 

Fourth- default shares for groups and an advanced expense adding experience for things like meals where tax and tip might be separate from the item subtotal. This includes a calculator in the subtotal area as well. 

Overall- the app looks a little dated. But who cares. All the basic functionality is there, it’s the fastest to add an expense, and only appropriate functionality is behind the paywall (like categories, receipt storage, and recurring transactions).",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=737534985&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

I wish it had 3 relatively small features that I proposed to the authors that could be implemented (had no negative or positive response from the authors so far).

Ability to assign a fixed amount to a person(s) and exclude them from further sharing. Use case: a participant bought something completely different and their prices are fixed regarding the rest of the spending
Ability to assign adjustments for sharing. Use case: in a restaurant, the entire bill is split evenly but one person ordered an expensive drink for himself and wants to exclude this amount from sharing, or a person didn’t order an expensive dessert and its share should be reduced by this amount
Ability to create a paying group which is very natural in multi-family events (especially with children who could be accounted for differently). All calculations are as is but in the end, group spending and debts are combined. It makes regular accounting simple. No multipliers, all other accounting as described in 1) and 2) are still applicable on the individual level but the final settlement is natural
The nice thing is that all these features could be introduced in a way that the old interface would work the same way without additional complexity for those who are not interested yet accommodating more complex use cases. 

I hope developers would listen to this proposals, it doesn’t look too complex and should not change the existing API too much",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=737534985&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

It allows weighted contributions for people… for example, a married couple can have an assigned value of 2, and single people can have a value of 1. Making it so an even split bill (such as a taxi or hotel) will automatically split appropriately. If you’re traveling through multiple countries with multiple currencies, it will accurately convert the consolidated debts of each person in a group. We used to spend hours obsessing over who owes what at the end of a trip, but it’s not an issue anymore. It’s worth purchasing premium for the group (one time cost, benefits all transactions within the group). Groups can be reset after a trip is complete, which means you can continue having the perks of premium for a future trip at no extra cost.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=737534985&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

I recently installed the new version of Settle Up (by paying 2€ of course) and I was expecting big improvements but unfortunately this version let me down.

There are three main issues that I would like to highlight:

- Edit payments amounts it is not possible. The new amount will be added to the old one, instead of replacing it. Or if there is a way to do it, I don’t find it.
- Weight payments is very difficult to handle. You have to play with the values to match to the expenses of every single member of the group.

For example: There is a payment of 10€ common for 3 friends, but only two of them have paid: A pays 2€ and B pays 8€. I would expect that the App lets me introduce the quantities directly, otherwise I have to calculate the weights, which has no sense within an App that does everything automatically.

- Last but not least, it is the user experience. I think the App has not been tested in real scenarios. When there are more than 6-7 members you cannot insert the name and see the name at the same time while typing. It could be a rendering issue.

I find this App very practical and interesting and I hope all together we can improve its performance.

Many thanks in advance and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Álvaro",https://itunes.apple.com/de/review?id=737534985&type=Purple%20Software,,,,
