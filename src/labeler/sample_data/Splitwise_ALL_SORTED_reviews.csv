What could be better:

1. Navigating within the app. The current layout & menus can be confusing.

2. Make it possible/easier to permanently erase individual transactions, groups of transactions, and group or entire histories from one's account.  Legacy info can ""bleed into "" more recent activity & throw off calculations, making the app ineffective at its main job.

3. Offer users an option to permanently delete their account, & permanently erase ALL data associated with it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

Other than that, this app has everything I need! It works really well. Alot of thought and polish has gone into it. 

Paying for premium is 100% worth it since my roommates and I need to split a lot of group purchases. With the paid version you can automatically (with little need for manual corrections) itemize a paper receipt. The only problem is you have to take a picture, you can‚Äôt use the auto itemize feature if the receipt forms from an existing photo. To do that I have to pull the photo up on another screen and use the Splitwise app to take a picture of the picture of the receipt. It seems like a glaring lack when the rest of the app is so polished. Splitwise makes it really easy to carve up any receipt, you can choose how to split it by item, by different percentages for each person, or just manually enter amounts everyone owes.

The only other feature I want added is the ability to work in split screen on an iPad. Right now I have to pull Splitwise up on my phone and set it next to my iPad when I want to review my budget, until I can put Splitwise in split screen then I‚Äôll need two devices to manage my finances.

I understand ads and up-charging for premium functions but to limit the actual use of your  core function seems counterproductive as a business model.

Recurring expenses are confusing to manage, buried in the mobile app UI, and inexplicably unavailable on the Web app. The feature to import credit card transactions has been broken for months, and even when it worked, it was poorly implemented‚Äîautomatically canceling pending payments, forcing you to wait until transactions completed to import them. Worse, expenses were sometimes deleted without warning or interaction.

Overall, the move to a subscription model without delivering meaningful Pro features feels unjustified. This direction has made the app less functional and has ultimately lost me as a customer.

I am using this app with my close family and friends I think function wise this is a very useful app.

BUT there is one big problem. The words written in Japanese is very hard to understand. I want to Change the language settings to English to not mistake anything I‚Äôve input for my family and friends.

Would you be able to fix the Japanese or be able to let me change the language settings to English?
I have tried to change settings from inside the app and from the settings app from my iPhone but both did not work.

Also one more advice specifically for Japan.
We do not use .00 for our currency YEN. 
 (Unless you are active in the currency market) 
So if you are able to erase the .00 that will make Japanese users very happy‚ò∫Ô∏è

1) one of my group members settled up without actually paying. Not a major issue outside the app, but it skewed what I was owed, and couldn‚Äôt be undone. I had to transfer all payments to a spreadsheet to make sure what the split was.
2) it doesn‚Äôt give a clear total or total split. Me and my BIL paid for everything on a holiday with my mum and sister. I‚Äôd liked to have seen a clear total spend and a very clear total for each person. Instead it‚Äôs all bits and bobs, just feels confusing to me. Again, the spreadsheet was simpler.

‚Äú
I am a longstanding user of Splitwise, and am familiar with your app. You‚Äôve made a change to your functionality recently, which is really annoying, and I wanted to give you feedback on this.
 
I am a free user, and have used Splitwise for a while. I use it primarily for house expenses with my housemates, and for holidays. The general approach I do with both of these is gather expenses, and then, at the end of the month (or at the end of the holiday) I upload all of the expenses in one go. 
 
However, what I have noticed is that you have now 1) limited the number of expenses one can upload in a single day; and 2) for the last couple of expenses of my limit, pound me with advert after advert, lasting ten seconds long, encouraging me to switch to Splitwise Pro. This is very irritating, and massively erodes the user experience. 
 
Now, I know what you‚Äôre going to say: ‚Äúit‚Äôs only ¬£4 a month, it‚Äôs half the price of a London pint, surely you can cough that up‚Äù. And indeed I could. But here‚Äôs the thing. I have, for years ‚Äì perhaps 6 years? ‚Äì used Splitwise and I have been just fine as before. I have never felt a need to switch to the Pro option. Obviously preferable to you would be to encourage me to the Pro option, but your solution to this is not to make the Pro option better ‚Äì and thus more attractive ‚Äì but instead to make the free version worse. If I want to get what used to be free, I now have to pay. This is clearly a recent decision, as I‚Äôve gone many years without ever encountering such limitations from you.
 
I really resent this style of commercialism. It doesn‚Äôt make the Pro option more appealing, it just makes Splitwise as an app less appealing! If you play this kind of game with me as a free user, and take stuff away, what‚Äôs to stop you doing it again. ‚ÄúOh, sorry, you want to upload unlimited expenses? Now you have to upgrade to Splitwise Pro Elite‚Äù, etc etc.
 
It also comes across as rather desperate. I mean, ten second adverts about Splitwise Pro if I want to upload an expense! How much do you want me to switch to your paid service! It reminds me of when someone at work wrote a colleague a sonnet to ask her out ‚Äì I mean chill out man, you ever heard of trying too hard! Surely the solution is to extract more money out of the advertising revenue stream and retain the original perks of free membership, are you really in that dire financial straits?
 
All of this is to say, I really do like your app, and would like to continue to use it ‚Äì but this change in functionality is not more likely to make me pay what is a small fee to move to the Pro option. I am more likely to create a google sheet, and ask friends to upload it that way.

The vast functionality and ease of use makes it the #1.

However, recent extreme aggressive pushes of Splitwise Pro have really ruined this app.

Splitwise Pro is a good offer and a good monetisation option, extended the feature locks and adding Timer ads/rewarded are understandable for monetising this free app.

However, core functionality breaking restrictions is an incredible extreme step that I feel is too far and also could result in a collapse of user base and NPS for Splitwise.

I would recommend instead Rewarded Video placement (ads for adding transactions) and IAP for 1 off group (e.g cheaper one off payments for groups).

But to break the app when people need is too radical so I can‚Äôt score this app more than 2*

Ich wollte gerade nach l√§ngerer Zeit mal wieder die App nutzen um ein paar Ausgaben mit meiner Freundin zu dokumentieren. Nach 2 Ausgaben wurde ich dann jedoch ausgebremst und musste mir f√ºr jede weitere erstmal 10 Sekunden Eigenwerbung f√ºr die Pro Version anschauen. Finde ich eine recht aggressive Strategie.

Ich muss sagen, ich nutze die App (und damit die Arbeit der Entwickler) schon seit Jahren ohne zu bezahlen. Dementsprechend habe ich eigentlich kein Recht mich zu beschweren, jedoch bin ich kein Freund von einem weiteren Abo, auch wenn es ‚Äûnur‚Äú 3‚Ç¨ im Monat sind.
Viel lieber w√ºrde ich einmalig zahlen was der Entwickler f√ºr angemessen h√§lt, ich w√ºrde 10-15‚Ç¨ sehen.

Dann verteilen sich die 10‚Ç¨ auf die Gruppe (einer zahlt halt √ºber seinen Apple Account, und die Kosten werden automatisch als gruppenausgabe verteilt). => Mehr Umsatz f√ºr Splitwise - weniger genervte Nutzer!
- Reduzierung der Anzahl an Transaktionen: bei Schuldenbegleichung sollte Splitwise automatisch die Anzahl an Transaktionen reduzieren. (A schuldet B 10‚Ç¨, B schuldet C 10‚Ç¨ - B kann aus der Kette eliminiert werden).
- Paypal Integration oder IBAN: w√§re sch√∂n wenn man automatisch bei Schuldenbegleichung die Zahlungsdaten der Gruppenmitglieder finden kann.

10895084307,CA,ASIJj,https://itunes.apple.com/ca/reviews/id944355818,24.1.1,1,A use case for bad monetization strategies,"I‚Äôve been using this app for years. Its not perfect, but the free version always fulfilled my needs. I use the app for tracking shared expenses and group expenses. I used to recommend and invite all my friends to this app, bringing the developer at least a dozen other users. 

Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt recommend it any longer.

In the last few months, the developer has been incredibly aggressive with pushing users into the paid version of the app. They‚Äôve limited the number of expenses you can add per day, making it harder to use the app when needed. Sometimes I do my accounting in batches, now I can‚Äôt. This causes me to forget expenses, losing track of them, and ultimately rendering the app useless.

They‚Äôve even gone as far as clawing back features that were once free, such at attaching photos to expenses, which is a pretty basic feature in similar apps.

I understand the need for monetization, it‚Äôs a business after all. However, it should be done by adding value to the user, not taking it away. 

Why not give users credits by watching ads, for example? Why not give users who share the app credits? 

This app just isn‚Äôt good enough to charge a premium subscription, in no world is it worth it. You‚Äôre charging for very basic functionality, clawing back features that justified the use of the app in the first place to convert users into buyers. It‚Äôs just bad practice, find a way to add value, or get more creative with your monetization strategy. 

I can only imagine this move will result in a drop of long term retention, losing users you might have paid for, who also invited their friends. The network effect is probably the best thing this app has going for itself, a way to grow organically.

As many others have said, this app was a nice little utility, but for me it was nothing more than a nice yo skin over what was previously being accomplished by a google sheet. 

However, lately they have been turning up the screws on their paid subscription. I was actually previously considering it for the feature which would allow you to set custom split proportions for groups, but now I‚Äôm not interested. 

They‚Äôve basically ruined the app. Prior to adding any expense they make you sit and wait for 12 SECONDS  while the app BEGS you to buy pro. Now they‚Äôve reduced the number of expenses you can add to 3/day???? I mean I guess this is fine if you add every expense as it happens, but most people, which I am sure they know, will settle their expenses weekly or monthly.

I understand the need to monetise the app, but this is the worst possible way to have done so. Ad banners dotted around the interface would literally be more tolerable.

Previously, users could swiftly input expenses, enhancing efficiency and convenience. However, this alteration disrupts the seamless experience, requiring users to pause between entries.

While the intention behind this change might be to encourage people to sign-up to their ‚ÄúPro Version‚Äù, it feels restrictive to users accustomed to the app's fluidity. The forced wait interrupts the flow of entering expenses, potentially leading to frustration, especially for those managing multiple transactions.

Given that this restriction wasnt there when I started to use the app, adding that now only shows the approach - ‚ÄúMake them captive and then make them pay‚Äù!

I find it incredibly helpful not for just remembering who owes who but also for who has paid what. I would find it useful to edit the Settle Up function or at least have the simplification of debts be optional. Sometimes I want to pay a friend before they pay me back because that‚Äôs the way my budget works, but I have to wait for them to pay me so I can then pay them. I would also like to able to allocate payments to specific debts. All that aside, it‚Äôs still a powerful tool that has made life and paying for things so much easier.

Person A owes Person B $15!!!

La possibilit√† di vedere le spese generali e di un lasso di tempo specifico. Si pu√≤ fare solo i un mese.

Parliamo dei pagamenti fissi ad esempio. Io con il mio compagno divido le spese di internet. Mi sono resa conto che ho scritto il nome della compagnia e non internet.

Para colmo, si est√°s dentro de una familia, cada componente tiene que pagar su propia aplicaci√≥n (no funcionando con las ventajas del modo familiar que tiene apple que permite compartir apps adquiridas entre miembros de la misma familia). Ni siquiera plantean una cuota ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù que permita hasta N usuarios.

Y para colmo‚Ä¶ no puedes pagar la app de una vez, sino que es una suscripci√≥n.

I would rather pay 5‚Ç¨ ONCE and don‚Äôt receive useless features for me like Splitwise Pay or other redesigns that doesn‚Äôt add value to the user that just want to split expenses.

Already recommended to other people, which are using it as well. I would consider upgrading to Pro, if there was the possibility to export a better report including all the information and attachments to Excel, not just the very basic text in one column. 
The possibility to including more than one attachment would also be great, sometimes it is nice to include the bank charge in addition to the proof of payment, contracts, etc. 
Also as a suggestion, the amount (number) is usually more difficult to remember then the description of the expense, so this field could come first, IMO is a very small change in the layout, but would make a big difference.",https://itunes.apple.com/br/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

Inclusive pago o Pro para utilizar os gr√°ficos, mas n√£o resolve meu problema por completo.

Dei ‚≠êÔ∏èestrela para a review ter chance de ser lida. Mas considero um app ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è estrelas, muito bom.

This app is not that complicated to create, any decent developer can do it easily. There are lots of analogues. 

Splitwise had it flaws. But it was familiar. So we used it. 
We mostly used it for trips with many people and small transactions. Now do we have to buy 20+ PROs? Or use few accounts to put in all the transactions (very inconvenient)?

Developers should get their money for creating an app. I agree. But you should choose ways of monetising wisely. And it is never base features.

We would pay for group subscription for example. So any member had no limit for this particular group. We would pay for every group we create. Each time. But paying for 20+ people at once is ridiculous.

Also realising it mid-trip was fun. If you finally decide to vanish this cool feature - you better make it very public. Cause no way anyone wouldn‚Äôt delete your app after this",https://itunes.apple.com/ru/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

You lose ALL the progress and all the time spent immediately unless you complete everyone‚Äôs record. 
This is an incredibly dumb UX and to make it a feature that you actually sell? That‚Äôs just ridiculous!",https://itunes.apple.com/ru/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

12541189739,IN,Anil Kariwala,https://itunes.apple.com/in/reviews/id151954315,25.3.2,5,Suggestion,"Dear Splitwise Team,

Splitwise is undoubtedly the best product in its category‚Äîintuitive, reliable, and incredibly useful. I have been a long-time user and admirer of the platform.

I would like to offer a suggestion that I believe could significantly enhance both user experience and your revenue model.

Many users‚Äîmyself included‚Äîuse Splitwise primarily for short-term group travel, where expenses need to be shared over a limited period. In such cases, the current monthly or annual subscription model may not feel justified, as it is not relevant to the duration or frequency of use.

A per-trip pricing model, limited to a specific number of days (say, 7‚Äì10 days), could cater perfectly to this use case. This would encourage more casual users to upgrade for the duration of their trip, without the hesitation that often comes with a longer-term commitment.

I had previously suggested a similar model to Slido, and they later introduced both monthly and per-event pricing‚Äîoffering flexibility while expanding their paid user base.

I truly believe that a flexible per-trip plan could unlock a new segment of paying users for Splitwise.

Thank you for the great product, and I hope you will consider this idea.

Best regards,
Anil Kariwala",https://itunes.apple.com/in/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

It then gives you an option to either create individual line item for each expense or use the total to split.

I‚Äôve used it for years between different groups of roommates I‚Äôve lived with, and to manage personal expenses with my partner. I love the interface of the app, how easy it is to use, and the different options for dividing expenses. That all changed today. I opened the app today to add in my expenses for a couple recent grocery shopping trips for my roommates and each time I wanted to add an expense I had to wait for ad to play, which was new and annoying, but I dealt with it. Then after I added 4 (just 4!) expenses I was met with a pop-up saying that I had reached the maximum number of expenses I could input today and I had to either upgrade to the pro version or wait until tomorrow to input more. I commonly put in 10 or 15 expenses all at once so I only have to do money management once or twice a month. There is nothing in the pro version of this app that I will use and it‚Äôs not worth the money just to be able to add my expenses when just a month ago I could add as many as I wanted to for free; which is why I specifically downloaded this app, as a free way to manage expenses with my roommates and partner.

Last feedback is that it would be great if when using the itemized feature, that items could be split by a custom % instead of only 50/50 or 100/0. Fingers crossed these updates are doable!

This app used to be great, but I haven‚Äôt used it in a few years. Picked it back up for a road trip and found that it now bombards you with (timed) ads for premium. I wouldn‚Äôt mind dropping $0.99 on it or what have you for the week I‚Äôm going to use it, but let‚Äôs be real: a decent spreadsheet on any platform with collaboration offers essentially the same value. So, Splitwise has apparently gone the route many apps have of trying to justify the higher price with additional ‚Äúvalue‚Äù by adding unnecessary features to the premium subscription like bank sync. I don‚Äôt want all that: I just want an app that offers an easier UI than the aforementioned spreadsheet. But roping me into a subscription for that essentially offline functionality leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

I recommend Splittr as a more reasonable alternative from an indie developer. You can use it entirely free and offline, or you can buy a 1-month ‚Äúpass‚Äù rather than being roped into a subscription you have to cancel. They have reasonably-priced long term options at the time of writing, as well.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

I‚Äôve used it for past couple of years to track expenses with group travel and also split expenses with my ex for our son. My use has been very basic and do not require the use of and of the pro features. Recently they limited the amount of transactions you can input a day to just 4! This is ridiculous as most people input all their transactions at the end of the month or at the end of a trip. The monthly fee they are asking is way to high for normal casual users who just want to use it when they got on trips with friends etc. a app that was so good and useful is pretty much ruined by being forced to watch a ad for the pro version and then being limited to only four transactions. Company seems greedy to me. I‚Äôll just go back to my excel spreadsheets. The multiple other negative reviews should be clear to splitwise they made a wrong business decision here.

I get asking for subscriptions for more premium actions like reporting and maybe even currency conversions, but now they won‚Äôt even let you add more than 2 transactions in the same day unless you buy ‚ÄúPro‚Äù. Their entire value proposition as an app is that people can easily add and split their expenses, limiting to 2 per day seems totally arbitrary and makes the free version useless.

I expect there are still options out there that aren‚Äôt so stingy on their Free version features. If not, Google Sheets it is.

Just a couple examples there. The final straw that made me unsubscribe from Pro and seek another service was that without fixing the gaps in their feature set, they added daily transaction limits to try to push people toward Pro, and force free users to watch ads. It used to be that you could use the core features easily and you would pay for Pro for the power user extras. Further, they made the confusing choice not to inform their existing users of this change before it took place.

And the AUDACITY to do this while basic things such as removing a payment method are missing, and have been for years, and without adding any new value to the app. They want to push people to pay them more money, without having done the work to deserve it.

It says the payment is pending, but I know that it will never complete. PLUS the user that sent the payment now has splitwise telling them they are ""settled up"".

If splitwise wanted or needed to add a subscription to your base app, you should not retract a previously free service. In my opinion, the additional benefits of pro are not worth the money and the free version transaction limit seems unnecessary. Use adds if you need to make more money.

To the developer: it‚Äôs understandable for you to want a steady revenue stream from subscriptions. This app, however, has very simple functionality that has not changed in many years.

 group cost for a wedding trip among 17 people, with numerous couples. 

It was ok adding costs using the ""split by shares"" feature for couples, however it would be better to be able to set the share amount on a per-person basis, as all couples were paying jointly. Without that feature it was annoying adding each cost, and when we had to add another party to the group I had to update all of the costs again. 

Also, at the end two people were owed money (myself and one other), however it was easier for me to act as the ""bank"" so all owed money would be sent to me and I would pay back the one other person owed. Splitwise has the ""simplify group debts"" feature, but that still produces a more complicated array of who owes whom. It would be simpler to communicate the final tally if there was an option to set one person as the ""bank"", especially since most of the people are not signed up (nor want to) to splitwise, and I am communicating the costs to them.

It would be great if the shares themselves were saved, not just the money conversion, so that follow-up adjustments were easy. 

2. If you change the date of an expense, it resets the split to ‚Äúequal‚Äù. All the work that has been done dividing a bill is lost! The shares/percentages etc of an unequal bill should be preserved if the date is changed.

- the ability to archive groups and preserve the list of transactions. For example, my friend paid me for a trip and when I hit ‚Äúsettle up‚Äù all the transactions went away. Would love to be able to archive and yet keep the transactions for reference.

- Consider combos like unlimited expenses + ads
- Consider a middle pricing tier. I don‚Äôt need analytics, but I would consider paying for more expenses + no ads",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

It says eg '8 people paid $80' if you get an $80 reimbursement. 

Ideally there would be an 'income' type, then whoever received the income would show '1 person received $80', and in balances you'd see the $10 owed to each other member.

Ich bin begeistert, weil relativ simple Mathematik hier gewinnbringend und praxisnah zur Anwendung kommt und jedermann das Leben erleichtert.

(Die ‚ÄûSchulden vereinfachen‚Äú Funktion d√ºrfte mathematisch komplexer sein, jedoch bin ich noch nicht hinter das Prinzip der Berechnung gekommen.)

Was ist top:

- Die grafische Oberfl√§che ist stylisch und sehr leicht verst√§ndlich.
- Die verschiedenen Arten des Splittens sind vielseitig und n√ºtzlich.
- Das Vereinfachen von Schulden insbesondere bei gr√∂√üeren Gruppen und l√§ngeren Reisen genial, da es den Aufwand f√ºr das Ausgleichen auf ein Minimum reduziert.

Was kann besser werden:

- Das Erstellen von Gruppen geht nur mit der Mail-Adresse aller Mitglieder. Eine einfache Kalkulation nur auf meinem Handy klappt indes nicht.
- Bei gr√∂√üeren Gruppen mit anwesenden Paaren w√ºrde ich oft gerne zwei Personen zu einem Paar mit gemeinsamer Geldquelle gruppieren, wenn zum Beispiel der Mann f√ºr die Frau mitbezahlt. 
- Das Einstellen eines Fotos f√ºr die Gruppe √ºber die Bildauswahl Funktion funktioniert beim iPhone aktuell nicht -> st√ºrzt ab.
- Bezahlmodell f√ºr die Provariante zu teuer f√ºr Gelegenheitsnutzer.

Ich w√§re sogar bereit gewesen, daf√ºr zu zahlen, aber nicht als Abonnement und sicherlich nicht zu einem j√§hrlichen Preis von 30 ‚Ç¨. Dieses Preismodell ist v√∂llig √ºberzogen und unversch√§mt. Es wirkt keineswegs durchdacht. Wie soll ich meine Freunde, mit denen ich in den Urlaub fahre, von dieser App √ºberzeugen, wenn es keine kostenlose Basisversion mehr gibt? Das neue Abonnementmodell wird meiner Meinung nach wahrscheinlich nach hinten losgehen.

Schnell hatte sich jeder Splitwise heruntergeladen und jeder fand sie auf Anhieb sehr einfach zu bedienen. 

Jeder hatte seine Kosten am Abend kurz eingetragen und Zack hatten wir am Ende des Urlaubs eine Berechnung unserer Ausgaben, sodass jeder wusste wer ‚Äûquitt‚Äú war oder noch was ‚Äûbekommt‚Äú.

Nach unserem Ski-Wochenende herrscht nun bedr√ºckte Stimmung, da ein Teilnehmer in extrem alkoholisierten Zustand die komplette Splitwise-Gruppe gel√∂scht und somit die komplette Budgetplanung durcheinander gebracht hat.

If there was an ad supported free option that was implemented well (tastefully, or watch an add after 10 expenses per day) I could probably get behind it.

It only keeps a running total, automatically offsetting everything.  That's fine if everyone pays and enters everything promptly.  If they don't, you have to reconcile everything manually and outside the system to work out what debts are outstanding, which undermines the whole point of the app. In practical terms, it's useless.  Actually, it is worse than useless - this app has wasted a lot of my time and created unnecessary tension between me and my housemates.  We would bd much better off having a list on our refrigerator and manually striking debts out as they are paid.

I can only enter my individual expense on the group I share with my husband. He has to do his data entry by himself. Else we have to choose a ‚Äúsplit‚Äù option. Why would you force that???
I should be able to do all this data entry by myself, even if I have to do it for the other members in my house!!

The below review is for Pro version:
Charts are restricted to a pie. 
Only absolute nos. no percentage split
No way to see who contributes how much share of the expenditure. 
In this post CoViD world, when all receipts are digital, I don‚Äôt see the point of receipt scanning.
Itemisation barely makes sense if you give just limited Color palette for high level items in the charts to start with.
In short, there is no way to analyse the Data if visualisation is so limited. Charge me for subscription but at least make it worthwhile.

Now one of the member is out for say 1 week and we don‚Äôt want that member to be included in the expenses, we have to manually inselect the member every time we add any transaction. Rather then this ee should have an option to disable that particular member for the time being.
