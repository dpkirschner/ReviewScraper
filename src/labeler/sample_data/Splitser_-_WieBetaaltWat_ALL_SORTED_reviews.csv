12495685326,US,TrinhThieuGia,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id202479310,4.0.31,4,Great app with room for 2 more improvements,"Great app. I love how clean it looks and how intuitive it is to use. However, there are two features I'd hope to see get added to the app soon:
1. Settle All Balances. We use this app for our monthly household spendings as well, and we'd like to have an option to not settle all balances among all individuals. Say if my brother owes me $10 and I owe my mom $10, we'd like options to settle twice, so we know what we owe each other and not have my brother pay my mom $10 directly. Currently, it's impossible to know so.
2. Ability to edit and move expenses to a different list. If we mistakenly input an expense to a wrong list, we have to delete and re-create the expense in the correct list.

Thanks!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1154059529&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

It‚Äôs missing some basic features tho, like for example on recurring expenses you can‚Äôt adjust the time of day which is set automatically for the time you inputted the recurring expense‚Äîso for example if I put it in at 5pm on the first of the month to repeat monthly, the expense won‚Äôt show until 5pm on the next first of the month, which gets confusing if someone checks in the morning to settle. Also you can‚Äôt edit recurring expenses so if you need to change something you have to create a new recurring expense, which is tedious. 

Also there‚Äôs no way to check off which  expenses you‚Äôre settling or not settling, you have to either settle all or none, which is also frustrating to work with.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1154059529&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

Along with that, into order record a payment of outstanding balance you have to record it as a whole and as a expense transaction to set off balances rather in splitwise you were able to make a customized payment as well (which reflected as a payment as well in summary).
