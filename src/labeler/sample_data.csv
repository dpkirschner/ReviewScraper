What could be better:

1. Navigating within the app. The current layout & menus can be confusing.

2. Make it possible/easier to permanently erase individual transactions, groups of transactions, and group or entire histories from one's account.  Legacy info can ""bleed into "" more recent activity & throw off calculations, making the app ineffective at its main job.

3. Offer users an option to permanently delete their account, & permanently erase ALL data associated with it.",https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=458023433&type=Purple%20Software,,,,

Other than that, this app has everything I need! It works really well. Alot of thought and polish has gone into it. 

Paying for premium is 100% worth it since my roommates and I need to split a lot of group purchases. With the paid version you can automatically (with little need for manual corrections) itemize a paper receipt. The only problem is you have to take a picture, you can‚Äôt use the auto itemize feature if the receipt forms from an existing photo. To do that I have to pull the photo up on another screen and use the Splitwise app to take a picture of the picture of the receipt. It seems like a glaring lack when the rest of the app is so polished. Splitwise makes it really easy to carve up any receipt, you can choose how to split it by item, by different percentages for each person, or just manually enter amounts everyone owes.

The only other feature I want added is the ability to work in split screen on an iPad. Right now I have to pull Splitwise up on my phone and set it next to my iPad when I want to review my budget, until I can put Splitwise in split screen then I‚Äôll need two devices to manage my finances.

I will use it for that function on every trip.

Settling up within the app however is terrible. Someone tried to pay me over $5000 and they were limited to $2000. The funds were not available to me for almost a week and then the maximum amount I could move to my bank account is $800.
